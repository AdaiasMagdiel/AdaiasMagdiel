## About Me

I'm a 21-year-old Brazilian student pursuing a degree in Mathematics Education and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Programming has been a passion of mine since I was 14, and I love doing it as a hobby, although I currently don't work in the field. However, I'm open to new opportunities that come my way.

### :computer: Tech Stack

I have experience in various programming languages, including:

- Python :snake:
- PHP :elephant:
- Javascript :zap: (including HTML :globe_with_meridians: and CSS :art:)
- Some (a little) experience in C and Java :books:
- I'm current learning Rust :crab:

### :books::blue_book::green_book: Learning and Curiosity

I'm a naturally curious person who is always eager to understand how the world works, and this curiosity continually drives me deeper into the world of programming. During my free time, I enjoy studying and experimenting with different technologies.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Projects

Here are some of the things I enjoy working on:

- Writing APIs in the languages I'm familiar with: :gear:
- Creating command-line programs to automate daily tasks: :computer:
- Building user interfaces with Vue.js: :art:

### :mortar_board: Studying for Fun

I'm enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge and honing my coding skills. Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. Let's keep coding and making the world a better place together! :rocket:

#### :punch: As the character Saitama would say:

> I'm just a guy who studies for fun.
